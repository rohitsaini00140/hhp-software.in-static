        title: "What is the typical software development lifecycle?",
        content: "The software development lifecycle (SDLC) typically includes phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase plays a crucial role in delivering a successful software product.",
      },
      {
        title: "What are the key differences between Agile and Waterfall development methodologies?",
        content: "Agile emphasizes flexibility and iterative development, with continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the project. Waterfall, on the other hand, follows a linear sequential flow, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.",
      },
      {
        title: "How do you ensure software quality during development?",
        content: "Quality assurance practices like unit testing, integration testing, and automated testing are integral to ensuring software quality. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines also help in maintaining high standards throughout development",
      },
      {
        title: "What role does documentation play in software development?",
        content: "Documentation serves as a crucial reference for developers, stakeholders, and future maintainers. It includes requirements documents, design specifications, user manuals, and API documentation, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the development process.",
      },
      {
        title: "How do you handle changes or updates to software requirements during development?",
        content: "Agile methodologies accommodate changes through iterative cycles and frequent feedback. Change management processes, such as assessing impacts, adjusting timelines, and re-prioritizing tasks, ensure that updates to requirements are managed effectively.",
      },
      {
        title: "What steps are involved in deploying a software product to production?",
        content: "Deployment involves preparing the software for release, including tasks like final testing, configuration management, setting up infrastructure, and ensuring compatibility with production environments. Post-deployment activities include monitoring performance and addressing any issues that arise."
